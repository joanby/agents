# Banoffee Pie Recipe

An easy family favorite with buttery pastry and sweet dulce de leche. Served with a generous dollop of cream and optionally garnished with dark chocolate.

## Ingredients

- 4 bananas, sliced
- 394g caramel or dulce de leche
- 300ml double cream
- Dark chocolate (optional, for garnish)

### For the pastry
- 100g butter, chilled (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg, separated
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

## Method

1. **Make the pastry case:**
   - Put the butter and flour in a food processor and pulse until it resembles fresh breadcrumbs.
   - Add the yolk of the egg and sugar, pulse until mixed.
   - Add very cold water (1 tbsp at a time), pulsing until the dough comes together.
   - Knead gently into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 30 minutes.

2. **Bake the pastry:**
   - Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4 and grease a 23cm loose-bottomed fluted tart tin.
   - Roll out the pastry and line the tin, leaving about 0.5 cm over the edge.
   - Line the base with baking parchment and weigh down with baking beans or rice.
   - Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the paper and beans.
   - Brush pastry with beaten egg white.
   - Return to oven for 15-20 minutes until crisp and golden.
   - Leave to cool completely.

3. **Assemble the filling:**
   - Spread half the caramel/dulce de leche on the cooled pastry case.
   - Layer sliced bananas on top.
   - Cover with the remaining caramel.
   - Chill in the fridge.

4. **Finish and serve:**
   - Whip the cream until thick and billowy.
   - Spoon the cream over the tart.
   - Garnish with finely grated dark chocolate if desired.
